# E.T and visual culture ontology (ETVCO): perspectives on Extraterrestrial influence in visual heritage
## Introduction
The E.T and visual culture ontology (ETVCO) project aims to develop a structured framework to model and analyze visual representations—such as sculptures, petroglyphs, and other artworks—associated with the ancient astronaut hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that extraterrestrial beings visited Earth in the distant past and influenced early human civilizations, leaving traces in their cultural artifacts and artistic expressions.

The ontology focuses on artifacts from ancient, medieval, and early modern periods, examining how different motifs, such as disk-shaped objects or humanoid figures, are interpreted by diverse perspectives, including archaeologists, art historians, and conspiracy theorists. It integrates both visual and cognitive dimensions, capturing the formal characteristics of artworks (e.g., shapes, motifs, and compositions) and the cognitive perspectivization processes underlying these interpretations. To achieve this, the project leverages well-established ontology design patterns like the Cognitive Perspectivisation Pattern (CP) and integrates ontologies such as ICON.

This project adopts the Extreme Design (XD) methodology to ensure a user-focused and iterative approach, incorporating competency questions and requirement stories tailored to stakeholders such as art historians, archaeologists, and cognitive scientists.

The ontology provides a robust foundation for documenting and analyzing visual heritage, emphasizing the cognitive mechanisms that influence how artifacts are interpreted across diverse perspectives. By integrating cognitive perspectivization processes, it sheds light on how conspiracy theorists, influenced by biases, such as confirmation bias and pattern recognition, construct alternative interpretations of visual motifs,  also influenced by their background knowledge, . This tool supports semantic queries that explore how such interpretations diverge from mainstream views, enabling interdisciplinary research into the cognitive frameworks and cultural contexts that shape these narratives. Ultimately, the project fosters a deeper understanding of the psychological and cultural dynamics underlying conspiracy theories related to historical artifacts.
